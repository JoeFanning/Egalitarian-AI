## A Theory of Justice 
by John Rawls: 

This is arguably the most important text in modern political philosophy and a cornerstone of liberal egalitarianism. Rawls proposes a theory of "justice as fairness," arguing for two principles:

- **Liberty principle:** Guarantees equal basic liberties for all.
- **Difference principle:** States that social and economic inequalities are only justified if they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.  

**Why it's essential:** Rawls's work set the terms of the debate for decades. Researchers either built upon his ideas or developed their own theories in direct response to his work.
