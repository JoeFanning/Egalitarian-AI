# Research Resources for Egalitarianism

**Liberté, égalité, fraternité**

French for 'liberty, equality, fraternity', this is the national motto of France and the Republic of Haiti, and is an example of a tripartite motto. Although it finds its origins in the French Revolution, it was only one motto among others and was not institutionalized until the Third Republic at the end of the 19th century. Debates concerning its meaning and implementation continue to this day.  

**Pierre Leroux:**  
A French philosopher and political economist, Leroux is often credited with popularizing the term in the 19th century. His works on socialism and human progress are a key place to find discussions of egalitarian ideas.  

**Alexis de Tocqueville:**  
In his famous work "Democracy in America," Tocqueville frequently discusses the rise of equality as a societal force. He is known to have used the term "égalitarisme" to describe these trends.  

Essentially, you would find the word in the works of 19th-century French thinkers who were either advocating for or critically analyzing the social and political movements that sought to create a more equal society.  

## A Theory of Justice  
by John Rawls

This is arguably the most important text in modern political philosophy and a cornerstone of liberal egalitarianism. Rawls proposes a theory of "justice as fairness," arguing for two principles:

- **Liberty principle:** Guarantees equal basic liberties for all.
- **Difference principle:** States that social and economic inequalities are only justified if they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

**Why it's essential:** Rawls's work set the terms of the debate for decades. Researchers either built upon his ideas or developed their own theories in direct response to his work.

​Essentially, you would find the word in the works of 19th-century French thinkers who were either advocating for or critically analyzing the social and political movements that sought to create a more equal society in the wake of the French Revolution.
