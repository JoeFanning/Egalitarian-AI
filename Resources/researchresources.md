## Historical Thinkers and the Origins of Egalitarianism

**Pierre Leroux**  
A French philosopher and political economist, Leroux is often credited with popularizing the term "egalitarianism" in the 19th century. His works on socialism and human progress are key resources for understanding early discussions of equality.

**Alexis de Tocqueville**  
In [Democracy in America](https://www.amazon.nl/Democracy-America-Complete-Unabridged-Volumes/dp/0553214640/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=2FC3TFIA5HEQV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GEWiUnX1BTMj77gRjWXr0OnpgvtL-6QYVVrm4Wn8NGJbklfMk28XoxUry04qcxOufwuPMagmfTZvQIASVH8fIybQZ0KTxqO7-ucp-Jb88QS-JLNYr85i8umFmwu3BeJJ7CRFywPBZkNKL027xCZbC7pwkrk_AinUD6ZzZmTJ85Ic48Rd_pgFVGReYjuUjHXTxEYkGUtoUBpw0HI37JhKkg.DvYj5wZ5jSceOqHJuwTUSLl6pRNAR1RuywSRIQSt9xU&dib_tag=se&keywords=democracy+in+america&qid=1755947444&sprefix=Democracy+in+Smerica%2Caps%2C127&sr=8-1) ,Tocqueville discusses the rise of equality as a societal force and uses the term "égalitarisme" to describe emerging trends in social and political life. His observations provide valuable insights into the development of egalitarian thought.

Many 19th-century French thinkers both advocates and critics grappled with the social and political movements aimed at achieving greater equality. Their writings remain foundational for contemporary egalitarian theory.

## Foundational Texts

## A Theory of Justice  
[A Theory for Justice](https://books.google.nl/books/about/A_Theory_of_Justice.html?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&redir_esc=y](https://books.google.nl/books/about/A_Theory_of_Justice.html?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&redir_esc=y)&hl=en) 

By John Rawls
(b. 1921, d. 2002) an American political philosopher in the liberal tradition. 

This book is arguably the most important text in modern political philosophy and a cornerstone of liberal egalitarianism. Rawls proposes a theory of "justice as fairness," arguing for two principles:

- **Liberty principle:** Guarantees equal basic liberties for all.
- **Difference principle:** States that social and economic inequalities are only justified if they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

**Why it's essential:** Rawls's work set the terms of the debate for decades. Researchers either built upon his ideas or developed their own theories in direct response to his work.

## The Social Contract

[The Social Contract](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cole-the-social-contract-and-discourses?hl=en-GB)  
By Jean-Jacques Rousseau (28 June 1712 – 2 July 1778), a Genevan philosopher, writer, and composer. His political philosophy influenced the progress of the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution.  

"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they. How did this change come about? I do not know. What can make it legitimate? That question I think I can answer."
