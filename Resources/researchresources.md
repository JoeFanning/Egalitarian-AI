## Historical Thinkers and the Origins of Egalitarianism

**Pierre Leroux**  
A French philosopher and political economist, Leroux is often credited with popularizing the term "egalitarianism" in the 19th century. His works on socialism and human progress are key resources for understanding early discussions of equality.

**Alexis de Tocqueville**  
In "Democracy in America," Tocqueville discusses the rise of equality as a societal force and uses the term "égalitarisme" to describe emerging trends in social and political life. His observations provide valuable insights into the development of egalitarian thought.

Many 19th-century French thinkers—both advocates and critics—grappled with the social and political movements aimed at achieving greater equality. Their writings remain foundational for contemporary egalitarian theory.

## Foundational Texts

**A Theory of Justice**  
*By John Rawls*  
Arguably the most influential text in modern political philosophy and a cornerstone of liberal egalitarianism. Rawls introduces "justice as fairness," grounded in two key principles:

- **Liberty Principle**: Guarantees equal basic liberties for all.
- **Difference Principle**: Permits social and economic inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society.

*Why it's essential*: Rawls's work set the terms of debate for decades, with many researchers building upon or responding directly to his ideas.

**The Social Contract**
